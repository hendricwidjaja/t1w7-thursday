# Advanced Data Types

## Lists [ ]
- They are ordered, mutable (changeable - can add, replace, or remove) collections of items.
- They are defined by enclosing elements in square brackets.
- Example: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", 1]

## Tuples
- They are ordered, immutable (values cannot be changed - cannot add, remove or replace values) collections of items.
- They are defined by enclosing elements in parenthesis / small brackets ()

## Sets
- They are unordered collection of unique elements (cannot have indentical elements).
- They are useful for membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference.
- Cannot access elements using index operator []. Need to check if the elements exists in the set.
- They are defined by enclosing elements in curly brackets {}.

## Dictionaries
- Collection of key-value pairs. They are also mutable.
- Each key-value is unique, and the keys are used to store and retrieve values.
